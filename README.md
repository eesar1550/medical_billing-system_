# medical_billing-system_
The Medical Billing System project is an Assembly language-based program designed to streamline the management of a small medical store's billing and inventory tracking processes. Developed using the 8086 architectures, this system facilitates essential operations such as password-protected access, menu-driven interaction, and transaction recording.
The primary objective of this project is to simulate a real-world billing system, enabling users to handle transactions efficiently. The system allows the user to input the number of medicines sold, calculates the total revenue earned, and displays inventory statistics. The program incorporates essential computational techniques like arithmetic operations, string handling, and ASCII-to-decimal conversions, showcasing the fundamental capabilities of low-level programming.
The project emphasizes the importance of robust data handling by:
•
Providing password-protected access for enhanced security.
•
Allowing users to choose actions through a user-friendly menu.
•
Maintaining real-time tracking of sold quantities and total earnings.
This project serves as a practical implementation of Assembly programming concepts and demonstrates the use of DOS interrupts for input/output operations, efficient memory management using the small memory model, and structured modular programming.
